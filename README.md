# Rational_Numbers_Project

This project uses data structures to organize simplified rational numbers. 
Data Structures used are as follows:

1. Array 
2. Vectors
3. Lists
4. Queue
5. Stack

First, user gets to choose what type of container they want to begin filling their rational numbers in. 
As the user begins to input rational numbers, it gets sorted in an ascending order. 
There are also input validation to make sure that invalid numbers are handled correctly.

Each container has its own sets of functions to manipulate the container's elements.
